# variables.

# Tip: you can use sshfs to mount a remote filesystem through ssh and
# give access here. By convention, the name should be "<remote
# terminus_name>" or "<remote user>@<remote host>", as seen from the
# host (echo $TERMINUS_NAME $USER@$HOSTNAME remotely). The path is
# where you mounted the filesystem. Using this technique, remote
# programs that try to display inline images from their own filesystem
# will succeed.
